Name
----
makerepropkg - Rebuild a package to see if it is reproducible

Synopsis
--------
makerepropkg [OPTIONS] <package_file>

Description
-----------

Given the path to a built pacman package, attempt to rebuild it using the
PKGBUILD in the current directory. The package will be built in an environment
as closely matching the environment of the initial package as possible, by
building up a chroot to match the information exposed in the package's
linkman:BUILDINFO[5] manifest. On success, the resulting package will be
compared to the input package, and makerepropkg will report whether the
artifacts are identical.

This implements a verifier for pacman/libalpm packages in accordance with the
link:https://reproducible-builds.org/[Reproducible Builds] project.

Options
