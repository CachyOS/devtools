archbuild(1)
============

Name
----
archbuild - a script to build an Arch Linux package inside a clean chroot.

Synopsis
--------
archbuild [options] -- [makechrootpkg args]

Description
-----------

'archbuild' is a script to build an Arch Linux package. archbuild is part of devtools but should only be used via one of the included symlinks:

* extra-x86_64-build
* gnome-unstable-x86_64-build
* kde-unstable-x86_64-build
* multilib-build
* multilib-staging-build
* multilib-testing-build
* staging-x86_64-build
* testing-x86_64-build

The symlink used to run it will be inspected by archbuild, to determine which target you want it to use. It will load the available pacman configuration from 'pacman-reponame-arch.conf' with a fallback to 'pacman-reponame.conf' from {pkgdatadir}. The makepkg configuration is loaded from 'makepkg-repo-arch.conf' with a fallback to 'makepkg-reponame.conf' from {pkgdatadir}.


Options
-------

*-h*::
	Output command line options.

*-c*::
	Recreate the chroot before building.

*-r* <dir>::
	Create chroots in this directory.
